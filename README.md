# Overview
At the University of Ruhuna, I spearheaded a project focused on developing a facial emotion recognition model. This model was designed to analyze facial expressions using advanced machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes. The primary goal of the project was to enhance customer feedback mechanisms during product launches and service interactions, providing valuable insights to inform business decisions.

# Project Description
The facial emotion recognition model aimed to accurately identify and categorize human emotions based on facial expressions captured through images or video feeds. By leveraging SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms, the model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of facial expressions, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in emotion detection.

# Key Components
### 01. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered a diverse dataset of facial images representing various emotions.
Applied advanced data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, feature extraction, and augmentation to improve model performance.

### 02. Model Development:

Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes algorithms to classify facial emotions.
Fine-tuned the models through cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best possible accuracy.

### 03. Integration and Deployment:

Developed a user-friendly interface for real-time emotion detection.
Integrated the model into customer feedback systems to analyze responses during product launches and service interactions.

### 04. Analysis and Reporting:

Provided detailed reports and visualizations of customer emotions, offering actionable insights for business strategies.
Enabled businesses to understand customer sentiment better, enhancing customer interaction and satisfaction.

# Technologies Used

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
### Naive Bayes

# Impact

The project significantly improved the ability of businesses to gauge customer emotions in real-time, allowing for more informed decision-making and personalized customer experiences. The insights derived from the model helped in refining products and services, leading to increased customer satisfaction and business growth.
