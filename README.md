Overview

At the University of Ruhuna, I spearheaded a project focused on developing a facial emotion recognition model. This model was designed to analyze facial expressions using advanced machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes. The primary goal of the project was to enhance customer feedback mechanisms during product launches and service interactions, providing valuable insights to inform business decisions.
